# Scheme48

This is my implementation of a Scheme interpreter written in Haskell. It follows the tutoral [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours). 

I not only wanted an excerise to help me learn Haskell, but I've also wanted to write a LISP interpreter, so this allowed me to do both.

I found the tutorial to be well-written and easy to follow, and enjoyed doing it. I would recommend it.
